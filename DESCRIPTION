Description: This package contains two functions, "meanest" to estimate the conditional mean and "covest" to estimate the conditional covariance using a Nadaraya-Watson kernel type estimator. The conditional mean and covariance is a function in the given/specific confounder and is estimated at a given value. Both functions need a selected bandwidth for smoothing, i.e. the higher the bandwidth the wider the kernel and the smoother the estimated mean or covariance function.
